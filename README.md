# SQL Tutorial Project
This project is a SQL project using the World Layoffs data. The data is composed of layoff information from the start of 2020 to the first three months of 2023. 
This is a tutorial hosted by Alex The Analyst, and shows the various ways SQL can be leveraged to clean and explore data. 

This project is a great starting project and demonstrates the various abilities needed to conduct clean and effective SQL statement writing, organising longer SQL scripts, commenting, and extracting insights from data. This repository has two files used in MySQL Workbench 8.0 and the CSV file for the layoff information.
